# Sprint 1_Capital_Quiz_Project

📄 **Description - Exercise Statement**

This project involves reading a file called `countries.txt` that contains countries and their capitals. The program will store the data in a `HashMap<String, String>`, where the key is the country name and the value is its capital.

After prompting the user for their name, the program will randomly display a country, and the user must enter the name of the corresponding capital. For each correct answer, the user earns a point. This process will repeat 10 times. At the end of the quiz, the program will save the user's name and score in a file called `classificacio.txt`.

## Functional Requirements
1. Read `countries.txt` and populate the `HashMap`.
2. Prompt the user for their name.
3. Randomly select a country from the `HashMap`.
4. Ask the user to input the capital of the selected country.
5. Track the user's score based on correct answers.
6. After 10 questions, write the user's name and score to `classification.txt`.
